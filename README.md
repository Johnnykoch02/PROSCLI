# PROSCLI

This tweaked form of the PROS CLI allows easy communication with the V5 Brain interfaced with Python, for VEX Robotics V5 Computer, over Serial line (Micro-USB) Developed under the premise that your V5 brian can recieve data processed in Python such as Computer Vision data ( that we will be using it for ) or even fully controlled by the external computer ( our end goal ).

Any questions my email is jkoch21@usf.edu

How do you use it?

Install into your perferred location on whatever device you will use to communicate with the V5 Brain
Tweak the port references
Using the terminals write to screen method, you can send any data you would like! Make sure to include the '\n' character or else it will not work
See test.py *
Is there a better way to do this? Probably, but this was the quickest solution our team found.
